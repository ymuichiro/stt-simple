## Installation

### Install from DMG (Recommended)

1. Download the latest [KotoType.dmg](https://github.com/yourusername/koto-type/releases/latest)
2. Double-click the downloaded DMG file
3. Drag KotoType.app to your Applications folder
4. On first launch, click "Open" when prompted by the security warning

### Build from Source

#### Prerequisites

- macOS 13.0 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Python 3.13
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager

#### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/koto-type.git
cd koto-type
```

2. Install dependencies (including dev dependencies)
```bash
make install-deps
```

3. Build the application (Python + Swift)
```bash
make build-all
```

4. Create the .app bundle
```bash
cd KotoType
./scripts/create_app.sh
```

5. (Optional) Create the .dmg disk image
```bash
./scripts/create_dmg.sh
```

## Usage

### Using Makefile (Recommended)

All operations can be executed through the Makefile. To see available commands:

```bash
make help
```

#### Application Commands

- `make run-app` - Launch the Swift application
- `make run-server` - Start the Python server (for testing)

#### Testing Commands

- `make test-transcription` - Run transcription tests
- `make test-benchmark` - Run performance benchmarks
- `make test-all` - Run all tests

#### Build Commands

- `make build-server` - Build Python server binary (PyInstaller)
- `make build-app` - Build Swift application
- `make build-all` - Build both Python and Swift
- `make install-deps` - Install Python dependencies (including dev)

#### Utility Commands

- `make clean` - Remove temporary files
- `make view-log` - View server logs

### Launching the Application

If installed from DMG:
1. Launch KotoType from Launchpad
2. Or run: `open /Applications/KotoType.app`

If built from source:
```bash
# Using Makefile (recommended)
make run-app

# Or run directly
cd KotoType
swift run
```

### First-Time Setup

On first launch, the "Initial Setup" screen will appear to verify the following:

1. **Accessibility Permissions** (for keyboard input simulation)
2. **Microphone Permissions** (for recording)
3. **FFmpeg Command Availability**

Follow the on-screen instructions to grant permissions and install dependencies, then click "Re-check" to continue.

> **Note**: Due to licensing considerations, FFmpeg is not bundled with the distribution.  
> You must have `ffmpeg` installed on your system (e.g., `brew install ffmpeg`).
>
> The distributed `.app`/`.dmg` includes the `whisper_server` binary, so Python and uv are not required for end users.
> During development only, if the bundled binary is not found, it falls back to `uv run`/`.venv` execution.

### Basic Operation

1. Launch the app - the KotoType icon appears in the menu bar
2. Press **Ctrl+Option+Space** to start recording
3. Press **Ctrl+Option+Space** again to stop recording
4. Transcription starts automatically, and the text is typed at your cursor position
5. Select "Import Audio File..." from the menu to transcribe `wav`/`mp3` files
6. Select "History..." to view past transcriptions
7. Enable "Launch at login" in "Settings... > General"
8. Select "Quit" or press **Cmd+Q** to exit

## Security Warning

This app is distributed with a free ad-hoc signature, so you may see a Gatekeeper warning on first launch.

### If You See a Warning

**Method 1: Right-click and "Open"**
1. Right-click or Ctrl+click on the app
2. Select "Open"

**Method 2: Allow in System Preferences**
1. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy
2. Click "Open"

This is normal behavior for apps without Apple Developer Program signing. After this, the app will launch without warnings.

## Testing

### Using Makefile (Recommended)

```bash
# Transcription tests
make test-transcription

# Performance benchmark tests
make test-benchmark

# Run all tests
make test-all
```

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Transcription tests
uv run python3 tests/python/test_transcription.py

# Performance benchmark tests
uv run python3 tests/python/test_benchmark.py
```

### Viewing Server Logs

```bash
# Using Makefile
make view-log

# Or directly
tail -100 ~/Library/Application\ Support/koto-type/server.log
```

### Noise Reduction Toggle

Noise reduction is enabled by default in audio preprocessing. To disable it for compatibility reasons:

```bash
export KOTOTYPE_ENABLE_NOISE_REDUCTION=0
```

### Auto Gain for Quiet Speech

Enabled by default. Automatically amplifies quiet audio before transcription.

```bash
export KOTOTYPE_AUTO_GAIN_ENABLED=1
```

Adjust threshold and amplification limits as needed:

```bash
export KOTOTYPE_AUTO_GAIN_WEAK_THRESHOLD_DBFS=-18
export KOTOTYPE_AUTO_GAIN_TARGET_PEAK_DBFS=-10
export KOTOTYPE_AUTO_GAIN_MAX_DB=18
```

### VAD Intensity for Noisy Environments

By default, VAD is set slightly stricter for noisy environments. To revert to traditional settings:

```bash
export KOTOTYPE_VAD_STRICT=0
```

### Type Checking and Linting

```bash
# Type checking (ty)
.venv/bin/ty check python/

# Linting (ruff)
.venv/bin/ruff check python tests/python

# Formatting
.venv/bin/ruff format python tests/python
```

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Using Makefile (recommended)
make build-all    # Build both Python and Swift
make build-server # Build Python server binary only
make build-app    # Build Swift app only

# Or run directly
cd KotoType
swift build
```

### Running

```bash
# Using Makefile (recommended)
make run-app

# Or run directly
cd KotoType
swift run
```

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
# Using Makefile (recommended)
make install-deps

# Or run directly
uv sync --extra dev
```

### Cleanup

```bash
# Using Makefile
make clean
```

### Distribution Build

```bash
# Complete build process
make install-deps  # Install dependencies
make build-all     # Build Python + Swift
cd KotoType
./scripts/create_app.sh    # Create .app bundle
./scripts/create_dmg.sh    # Create .dmg disk image (optional)
```

## Release Process

- Pushing to `main` branch triggers GitHub Actions to create a tag in format `v<VERSION>.<run_number>`
- Tag push triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml` to build `.dmg`
- Generated `.dmg` is automatically attached to the GitHub Release
- Release DMG does not include FFmpeg, so the initial setup requires system `ffmpeg`

Update the `VERSION` file to reflect in future tags and distribution versions.

### About PyInstaller

The Python server is packaged as a single executable using PyInstaller:

- **Command**: `uv run --extra dev pyinstaller --onefile --name whisper_server ...`
- **Output**: `dist/whisper_server`
- **Embedded at**: `.app/Contents/Resources/whisper_server`
- **C Extensions**: faster-whisper and ctranslate2 are automatically collected

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone Permissions
Allow microphone access on first launch when prompted.

### Whisper Model Download
The Whisper model (large-v3, ~3GB) is downloaded on first launch.

### Hotkey Not Working
Enable KotoType in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility.

### Python Server Binary Not Found
When creating distribution `.app`/`.dmg`, run `make build-server` to create `dist/whisper_server` before running `./scripts/create_app.sh`.

### PyInstaller Errors
Ensure dev dependencies are properly installed:
```bash
make install-deps
```
