### Setup Requirements

Before using KotoType, ensure you have:

- macOS 13.0 or later
- FFmpeg installed (for audio file conversion)
- Microphone access granted
- Accessibility permissions granted (for hotkeys)

## Troubleshooting

### General Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check Requirements**: Verify all prerequisites are met
2. **Review Logs**: Check server logs for errors
3. **Restart the App**: Quit and relaunch KotoType
4. **Check Permissions**: Ensure all required permissions are granted
5. **Update KotoType**: Make sure you're using the latest version

## Common Issues

### Microphone Not Working

**Symptoms**: Recording fails or no audio is captured

**Solutions**:
1. Check System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Microphone
2. Ensure KotoType is listed and enabled
3. Try restarting the app
4. Check if other apps are using the microphone

### Hotkey Not Responding

**Symptoms**: Ctrl+Option+Space doesn't start/stop recording

**Solutions**:
1. Check System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility
2. Ensure KotoType is listed and enabled
3. Verify no other apps are using the same hotkey
4. Try restarting the app

### Transcription Fails

**Symptoms**: Audio records but transcription doesn't work

**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection (Whisper model download)
2. Verify FFmpeg is installed: `ffmpeg -version`
3. Review server logs: `make view-log`
4. Ensure sufficient disk space (~3GB for Whisper model)

### Gatekeeper Warning

**Symptoms**: Security warning on first launch

**Solutions**:
1. Right-click on KotoType.app
2. Select "Open"
3. Click "Open" in the security dialog

This is normal for unsigned apps. After this, KotoType will launch normally.

### Slow Transcription

- CPU performance affects speed
- First run is slower (model download)
