## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this standard. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

**Be respectful**: Treat everyone with respect and professionalism.

**Be constructive**: Provide feedback in a helpful and constructive manner.

**Be inclusive**: Welcome contributors from diverse backgrounds and experience levels.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- macOS 13.0 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Python 3.13
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- FFmpeg (optional, but recommended)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/koto-type.git
cd koto-type
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment

```bash
# Ensure UV is installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

### 3. Build Swift Application

```bash
cd KotoType
swift build
```

### 4. Verify Installation

```bash
# Run Python tests
make test-all

# Run Swift app
make run-app
```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- Feature branches: `feature/your-feature-name`
- Bugfix branches: `fix/bug-description`
- Documentation branches: `docs/your-docs`

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes following the [Code Style](#code-style) guidelines.

3. Test your changes thoroughly (see [Testing](#testing)).

4. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new transcription option"
```

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages:
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test changes
- `chore:` Build process or auxiliary tool changes

5. Push your branch and create a pull request:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Testing

### Required Testing After Code Changes

**Important**: After making any code changes, you MUST:

1. **Write test code**: Create test code corresponding to the changed functionality
2. **Verify behavior**: Run the test code to confirm code behavior

This process is mandatory for all code changes, with no exceptions.

### Python Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test-all

# Run specific tests
uv run python tests/python/test_transcription.py
uv run python tests/python/test_benchmark.py
```

### Swift Tests

```bash
# From KotoType directory
swift test
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Basic Flow**: Recording → Transcription → Input
2. **Short Audio**: 1-2 second utterances
3. **Long Audio**: 30 second utterances
4. **Silence**: Behavior with no audio input

### Type Checking and Linting

```bash
# Type checking (ty)
.venv/bin/ty check python/

# Linting (ruff)
.venv/bin/ruff check python tests/python

# Formatting
.venv/bin/ruff format python tests/python
```

## Code Style

### Python

- **Type Checking**: Use `ty` for type checking
- **Linting**: Use `ruff` for linting
- **Formatting**: Use `ruff format` for formatting
- **Documentation**: Include docstrings for all public functions and classes
- **Naming**: Follow PEP 8 naming conventions
- **Imports**: Group imports (standard library, third-party, local) with blank lines between groups

Example:
```python
"""Module docstring."""

from typing import Optional

import faster_whisper

from local_module import local_function


def transcribe_audio(audio_path: str, language: str = "ja") -> Optional[str]:
    """Transcribe audio file using Whisper.
    
    Args:
        audio_path: Path to audio file
        language: Language code (default: "ja")
        
    Returns:
        Transcribed text or None if transcription fails
    """
    # Implementation
```

### Swift

- **Naming**: Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
- **Comments**: Keep to a minimum, let code be self-documenting
- **Error Handling**: Use `do-catch` for error handling
- **Access Control**: Use appropriate access modifiers
- **SwiftUI**: Follow SwiftUI best practices

Example:
```swift
/// Transcribe audio file using Whisper
func transcribe(audioPath: String, language: String = "ja") -> String? {
    // Implementation
}
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

1. **Check existing issues**: Search for existing PRs that address the same issue
2. **Write tests**: Add tests for new functionality or update existing tests
3. **Update documentation**: Update relevant documentation (README, DESIGN.md, etc.)
4. **Run all tests**: Ensure all tests pass
5. **Check code style**: Ensure code follows style guidelines
6. **Commit messages**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages
